  <Entry File="snmayor\4.wav" ID="4">“Then,Ifalna,  please tell us about the Cetra.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\5.wav" ID="5">“Tell us,Ifalna…  Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\6.wav" ID="6">“Ifalna,  what exactly does Planet-reading entail?”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\7.wav" ID="7">“Do the Ancients,rather,the Cetra,  have special powers to heal the Planet?”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\8a.wav" ID="8" Part="a">“Hmm,even here so close to  the North Cave,  the snow never melts.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\8b.wav" ID="8" Part="b">“Is that because  the Planet's energy is  gathered here to heal its injury?”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\9.wav" ID="9">“Ifalna…  Let's take a break.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\10.wav" ID="10">“Who is the person that appeared  at the North Cave?  I haven't any idea.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\11.wav" ID="11">“You don't look well…  Let's call it a day.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\12.wav" ID="12">“Camera's ready!”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\13a.wav" ID="13" Part="a">“2000 years ago,our ancestors,  the Cetra,heard the cries of  the Planet.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\13b.wav" ID="13" Part="b">“The first ones to discover  the Planet's wound were the Cetra  at the Knowlespole.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\14.wav" ID="14">“Knowlespole refers to this area.  The Cetra then began a Planet-reading.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\15a.wav" ID="15" Part="a">“…I can't explain it very well,but  it's like having a conversation  with the Planet…”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\15b.wav" ID="15" Part="b">“It said something fell from the sky  making a large wound.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\16a.wav" ID="16" Part="a">“Thousands of Cetra pulled together,  trying to heal the Planet…”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\16b.wav" ID="16" Part="b">“But,due to the severity of the wound,  it was only able to heal itself  over many years.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\17a.wav" ID="17" Part="a">“No,it's not that kind of power.  The life force of all living things  on this Planet becomes the energy.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\17b.wav" ID="17" Part="b">“The Cetra tried desperately to  cultivate the land so as not to  diminish the needed energy…”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\18a.wav" ID="18" Part="a">“Yes,the energy that was needed to  heal the Planet withered away  the land…then the Planet…”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\18b.wav" ID="18" Part="b">“The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra  to leave the Knowlespole,but…”</Entry>

  <Entry File="snmayor\20.wav" ID="20">“That's when the one who injured the Planet…  or the 'crisis from the sky',  as we call it,came.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\21.wav" ID="21">“The Cetra were attacked  by the virus and went mad…  transforming into monsters.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\22a.wav" ID="22" Part="a">“That's when it appeared!”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\22b.wav" ID="22" Part="b">“It looked like…our…our dead mothers  …and our dead brothers.  Showing us specters of their past.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\23.wav" ID="23">“It first approached as a friend,  deceived them,and finally…  gave them the virus.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\24a.wav" ID="24" Part="a">“Then,just as it had  at the Knowlespole.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\24b.wav" ID="24" Part="b">“It approached other Cetra clans…  and infected them with…the virus.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\25.wav" ID="25">“Ifalna,  can you comment  on the thing called 'Weapon'?”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\26.wav" ID="26">“Back then,Weapon was a weapon  the Planet produced by its own will?”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\27.wav" ID="27">“So,Weapon no longer exists  on this Planet?”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\28.wav" ID="28">“Where is Weapon?”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\29.wav" ID="29">“…Thank you,Ifalna,  that will be all for today…”</Entry>

  <Entry File="snmayor\32.wav" ID="32">“Weapon cannot vanish.  …It remains asleep  somewhere on the Planet.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\33a.wav" ID="33" Part="a">“I don't know…  I can't hear  the voice of the Planet well…”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\33b.wav" ID="33" Part="b">“Times…have changed.  The Planet…is probably  watching this situation closely.”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\34a.wav" ID="34" Part="a">“The one the Professor mistook for  a Cetra…was named Jenova.  That is the 'crisis from the sky'.”</Entry>

  <Entry File="snmayor\35a.wav" ID="35" Part="a">“Even though Jenova is confined,  it could come back to life  at some time…”</Entry>
  <Entry File="snmayor\35b.wav" ID="35" Part="b">“The Planet has not  fully healed itself yet.  It's keeping watch on Jenova.”</Entry>
